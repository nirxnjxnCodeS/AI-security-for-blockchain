# AI-security-for-blockchain


AI Security for Blockchain is an intelligent smart contract analyzer that leverages GPT models to detect vulnerabilities, suggest fixes, and ensure security best practices for Solidity-based contracts.

## 🚀 Features
- 🔍 Automatic vulnerability detection (reentrancy, overflow, access control)
- ⚙️ Gas optimization recommendations
- 🧩 JSON-formatted AI security reports
- 🪄 Real-time analysis using OpenAI’s API
- 🌐 Simple integration with DApps

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** Next.js, TypeScript, TailwindCSS  
- **Backend:** Node.js, Axios  
- **AI Engine:** OpenAI Responses API (GPT-5-nano)  
- **Blockchain:** Ethereum (Sepolia Testnet, MetaMask)

## ⚡ How It Works
1. Paste your Solidity smart contract code.
2. The AI model analyzes it for critical issues.
3. Receive a structured report with risk levels and recommendations.
